=====Message of the Day======

Recently OCTGN did some changes in the way scripts handle face-down card visibility, so I had to make some changes to work with the new paradigm.

It's possible that this introduced bugs, and even though I tested the basic accesses, it may still be the case that something slipped through. 

On the positive side, HQ and R&D access should now be much faster.

Please let me know if you encounter any weird issues so that I can fix ASAP.

Thanks and enjoy!
