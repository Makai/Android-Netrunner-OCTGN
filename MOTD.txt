=====Message of the Day======

Order and Chaos is now Rezzed!

As always, most cards have been scripted. Check the changelog for tricky scripts. 

I tried to get this ASAP so there might be some bugs remaining. Please lemme know if you find any

Note: Itinerant Protesters and Satellite Grid need *Manual Tracking*

PS: Bug where corp lost control of their server cards when runner accessed them should be fixed now.
